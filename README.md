# COVID-19 Mobile Applications Permissions

Since the [WHO](https://www.who.int/) decided to define the outbreak of COVID-19 as a public health emergency of international concern, we have seen a lot of mobile applications being published that aimed to help tracking news, showing updates, providing information about symptoms and lately trying to track infected people and inform others that might've had contact with them.

However, it's somewhat difficult to determine what are the permissions each application is asking for and what are their capabilities before installing them. So I decided to compile a list of applications related to COVID-19 and detail the capabilities and permissions they request.

The full list of applications is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_apps), but not all of them are available on the US App Store.
